## Projects
Currently im working on Retro Invasion,
you check out the demo [here](https://wilsonn.itch.io/retro-invasion) and give your feedback.

### Retro Invasion
is a card game RPG but instead of being turn based, combat goes on in real time, resulting in a fast paced and chaotic combat system forcing the player to adapt and improvise.

The documentation for the project is still work in progress ;)
