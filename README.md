# Hi there âœ¨
### I'm Sean
a dedicated **game programmer**, passionately delving into the world of interactive experiences. Currently, I'm pursuing my degree in Game Application and Technology, honing my skills to craft captivating gaming adventures. My journey has been enriched by participating in various game development competitions, where I've showcased my creativity and technical proficiency.

## Projects
Currently im working on Retro Invasion,
you check out the demo [here](https://wilsonn.itch.io/retro-invasion) and give your feedback.

### Retro Invasion
is a card game RPG but instead of being turn based, combat goes on in real time, resulting in a fast paced and chaotic combat system forcing the player to adapt and improvise.

The documentation for the project is still work in progress ;) \
